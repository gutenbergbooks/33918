<p>In the order of our Library "Mr. Punch with the Children" comes last,
yet, so continual and sincere has been the interest of the breezy little
man in the children, we might well have placed this volume first. The
<i>Punch</i> pictures, stories and jests that are concerned with the young
folk are almost inexhaustible. The present collection, though containing
the cream of them, comes very far indeed from reproducing them all, or
even fifty per cent. For every notable artist and writer who has been
much associated with <i>Punch</i> since 1841 has had something to say or to
illustrate of the humours of child life. If genius be the power to be a
child again at will, we can understand this abiding interest in the
doings of the children. <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> himself resembles Peter Pan, for he
has never grown up. The years roll by, but the jolly little hunchback
remains as young as ever.</p>

<p>The variety of individuality in the children, to whom we are here
introduced, is noteworthy. In the days of Leech, downright impudence
seems to have been a characteristic of the young; to-day it would seem
children are better mannered, even if the <i>enfant terrible</i> is still
thriving and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> likely to do so. There are nice children here, and naughty
ones; clever and dull children; pretty and ugly children&mdash;the
mischievous are chiefly memories of last generation! Phil May's children
are all clearly of the "gutter snipe" order, in which he delighted, full
of character and a somewhat pathetic humour; but how clean and sweet and
lovable are Du Maurier's or Mr. Lewis Baumer's! Mr. Raven-Hill seems to
be attracted somewhat in the same direction as Phil May; but all are
interesting, and their sayings and doings are eminently worthy to be
thus permanently gathered into one volume.</p>

which precedes his interesting work on the world before the flood,
condemns the practice of awakening the youthful mind to admiration by
means of fables and fairy tales, and recommends, in lieu thereof, the
study of the natural history of the world in which we live. Fired by
this advice, we have tried the experiment on our eldest, an imaginative
boy of six. We have cut off his "Cinderella" and his "Puss in Boots,"
and introduced him to some of the more peaceful fauna of the preadamite
world, as they appear restored in Mr. Figuier's book. The poor boy has
not had a decent night's rest ever since!</p>

<h2>AT A CHILDREN'S PARTY</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">During Tea</span></center>

<p>Yes, <i>isn't</i> it a pretty sight.... Oh, they're <i>much</i> too busy to talk
at present.... Well, if you <i>would</i> take this cup of tea to my little
girl, dear Mr. Muffett, it would be so&mdash;&mdash;Yes, in the white frock....
<i>Pray</i> don't apologise&mdash;some tea upsets <i>so</i> easily, doesn't it?... Oh!
I don't suppose it will show, really, and if it <i>does</i>.... Please, will
everybody keep quite quiet for a minute or two; I haven't said my
grace.... Don't you think it's unfair of nurse? She's handed me
bread-and-butter twice running!... I mustn't eat sponge-cake, thank you.
Bath buns are better for me than anything.... I was <i>so</i> ill after
Christmas. They took my temperament with the barometer, and it was two
hundred and six!... Oh! that's nothing. When <i>I</i> was ill, the doctor
said mine was perfectly Norman!... Well, you <i>might</i> lower that
candleshade a <i>very</i> little, perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> Mr. Muffett.... Ah! don't blow
it out.... Throw it into the fire, quick!... It doesn't matter in the
<i>least</i>. No; I wouldn't trouble about the <i>other</i> shades, thanks....
Mother, will you read me the text out of my cracker?... But if you're
going to be a soldier, you oughtn't to shut your eyes when you pull a
cracker.... Oh! when I'm a soldier, I needn't <i>go</i> to parties.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">During a Performance of Punch and Judy</span></center>

<p><i>A Thoughtful Child.</i> What a dreadful thing it would be to have a papa
like Punch!</p>

<p><i>A Puzzled Child.</i> Mother, why is the man at the side so <i>polite</i> to
Punch? He calls him "Sir"&mdash;is Punch <i>really</i> a gentleman?</p>

<p><i>A Good Little Girl.</i> I do wish they would leave all the fighting out;
it must set such a bad example to children.</p>

<p><i>An Appreciative Boy.</i> Oh! I say, <i>did</i> you hear what the clown said
then? He said something had frightened all the hair off his head except
that little tuft at the top, and it turned <i>that</i> sky-blue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He goes into fits of laughter.</i></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>

<p><i>A Matter-of-fact Boy.</i> Yes, I heard&mdash;but I don't believe it <i>could</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Child of the House.</i> I <i>am</i> so glad Tip is shut up downstairs,
because I'm afraid, if he'd been up here and seen Toby act, he'd have
wanted to run away and go on the stage himself, and I don't think he's
the sort of dog who would ever be a <i>success</i>, you know!</p>

<center><span class="smcap">During the Dancing</span></center>

<p><i>Jack.</i> I say, Mabel, you've got to dance the "Washington Post" with
<i>me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mabel.</i> I can't. I've promised Teddy Thistledown.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh! <i>that's</i> all right. I swapped with him for a Nicaragua
stamp.</p>

<p><i>Mabel</i> (<i>touched</i>). But aren't they rare? Didn't you want it yourself?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh! I don't collect, you know.</p>

<p><i>George</i> (<i>to Ethel</i>). They've given us the whole of "Ivanhoe" to mug up
for a holiday task. Isn't it a beastly shame?</p>

<p><i>Ethel.</i> But don't you like Scott?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p><i>George.</i> Oh! I don't mind <i>Scott</i> so much. It's having to grind in
the holidays that <i>I</i> bar.</p>

<p><i>Hester</i> (<i>to Roland</i>). Shall you go to the pantomime this year?</p>

<p><i>Roland.</i> I don't think so. I'm going to lectures at the Royal
Institution instead.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> That isn't as jolly as the pantomime, is it?</p>

<p><i>Roland</i> (<i>impartially</i>). Not while it's going on, but a lot jollier
after it's over.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Poffley</i> (<i>a middle-aged bachelor, who "likes to make himself
useful at parties," and is good-naturedly waltzing with little Miss
Chillington</i>). Have you&mdash;er&mdash;been to many parties?</p>

<p><i>Miss Chillington</i> (<i>a child of the world</i>). About the usual amount.
There's generally a good deal going on just now, isn't there?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Poffley.</i> A&mdash;I suppose so. I go out so little now that I've almost
forgotten <i>how</i> to dance.</p>

<p><i>Miss Chillington.</i> Then you <i>did</i> know once!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Poffley</i> (<i>completely demoralised</i>). I&mdash;er&mdash;you would rather stop?</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<p><i>Miss Chillington.</i> Oh! I don't mind going on, if it amuses you.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Mr. Poffley feels that "children are not so grateful as they used
to be for being noticed," and that it is almost time he gave up
going to juvenile parties.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Hostess</i> (<i>returning to the drawing-room to find the centre of the
floor occupied by a struggling heap of small boys, surrounded by
admiring but mystified sisters</i>). Oh! dear me, what <i>are</i> they doing?
I'm so afraid my two boys are being too rough, Mrs. Hornblower.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hornblower</i> (<i>one of a row of complacent matrons</i>). Oh! not at
all, dear Mrs. Honeybun, they're having <i>such</i> fun. Your Edwin and
Arthur are only trying how many boys they can pile on the top of my
Tommy.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Honeybun.</i> Is that Tommy underneath? Are you sure he's not getting
hurt?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn.</i> Oh! he thoroughly enjoys a romp.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> He's made himself
perfectly hoarse with laughing. Just listen to him!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Honey.</i> What a sturdy little fellow he is! And always in such high
spirits!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn</i> (<i>confidentially</i>). He hasn't seemed quite the thing for the
last day or two, and I was doubting whether it wouldn't be better to
keep him at home to-night, but he begged so hard that I really had to
give way.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Honey.</i> So glad you did! It doesn't seem to have done him any
harm.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn.</i> Quite the contrary. And indeed, he couldn't help being the
better for it; you understand so thoroughly how to make children happy,
dear Mrs. Honeybun.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Honey.</i> It's delightful of you to say so; I try my best, but one
can't always&mdash;&mdash;Last year we had a conjurer, and it was only when he'd
begun that we found out he was helplessly intoxicated.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn.</i> How disagreeable for you! But this time everything has been
quite perfect!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Honey.</i> Well, I really think there has been no&mdash;&mdash;Good gracious!
I'm <i>sure</i> somebody is being suffocated! <i>Did</i> you hear that?</p>

<p>[<i>From the core of the heap proceeds a sound at which every mother's
heart quakes&mdash;a smothered cough ending in a long-drawn and ominous
"oo-ook.'</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn.</i> Depend upon it, that's whooping-cough! Tommy, come here
this minute. (<i>Tommy emerges, crimson and crowing lustily; the mothers
collect their offspring in dismay</i>). Oh! Tommy, Tommy, don't tell me
it's <i>you</i>! It&mdash;it can't be <i>that</i>, dear Mrs. Honeybun; he's been
nowhere where he could possibly&mdash;&mdash;You naughty boy, you <i>know</i> you are
only pretending. Don't let me hear that horrid noise again.</p>

<p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>injured</i>). But, mummy, <i>really</i> I wasn't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He justifies himself by producing a series of whoops with an
unmistakably genuine ring</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Horn.</i> I think it's only a rather severe attack of hiccoughs, dear
Mrs. Honeybun; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
still, perhaps&mdash;just to be on the safe side&mdash;I'd
better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She departs in confusion, the crowd on the stairs dividing like
Red Sea waves as Tommy proclaims his approach.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Honey</i> (<i>after the last guest has gone</i>). I knew <i>something</i> would
happen! I must say it was <i>most</i> inconsiderate of Mrs. Hornblower to
bring that wretched little Tommy out and break up the party like
this&mdash;it's not as if we were really <i>intimate</i>! Still, it was ridiculous
of everybody else to hurry off too, as if whooping-cough was anything to
be so mortally afraid of! I wasn't in the <i>least</i> myself, as they might
have seen. But perhaps it <i>is</i> just as well that Edwin and Arthur had it
last winter.</p>
